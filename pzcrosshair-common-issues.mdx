## Common Issues

There are currently no known common issues for pz_crosshair.

The script is designed to run flawlessly, but misconfiguration can prevent the UI from appearing or crosshairs from rendering correctly.

## Troubleshooting Tips

If you find that the crosshair is not showing, overlapping, or the menu won't open:

* **Check Config**: Ensure you haven't missed a comma , or made a syntax error in your configuration file.

* **Check Dependencies**: Ensure ox_lib (and pz_utility if enabled) is installed and started before pz_crosshair in your server.cfg.

* **Core Configurations**: Check your core framework (e.g., QBCore, ESX) or other weapon/HUD scripts for built-in crosshair settings. Be sure to disable any default crosshairs to prevent overlapping or conflicts with pz_crosshair.

* **Image URLs**: If a custom image crosshair isn't loading, ensure the URL is a direct link to an image file (e.g., ends in .png or .jpg) and is hosted on a reliable, public domain.

* **Reinstall Files**: Ensure the resource is fully updated and no files are missing or corrupted.
