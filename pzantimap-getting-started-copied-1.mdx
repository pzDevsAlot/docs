Getting Started

pz_wipes is a modular, high-performance cleanup system built to keep your FiveM server running smooth and stable.

It intelligently manages world entities (Vehicles, Peds, Objects) to reduce lag, clear debris, and prevent griefing — all without disrupting roleplay.

Features

🚗 Smart Vehicle Wipe: Automatically removes broken, exploded, or abandoned vehicles.

Protects: Player‑owned vehicles (via oxmysql DB check), vehicles with drivers/passengers, and whitelisted models.

🧱 Anti‑Grief Object Wipe: Cleans up modder spam (cages, windmills, UFOs) and common debris (cones, boxes) using a configurable blacklist.

🧍 Ped Cleanup: Removes dead bodies or glitchy locals. (Default: Manual command only to protect RP scenarios.)

🛑 Safezone System: Prevents wipes in protected areas (Legion, dealerships, etc.).

🔊 Audio Warnings: Immersive audio countdowns notify players before wipes occur — no intrusive UI.

🧩 Framework Agnostic: Works out‑of‑the‑box with QBCore, ESX, and Ox Core.

🛠️ Developer Friendly: Open custom.lua hooks allow custom logic without touching encrypted code.
