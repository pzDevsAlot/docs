## Core Settings

### ⏱️ Schedules

You can adjust the frequency of automatic cleanups.

*   **Interval**: Time in minutes between wipes (Default: 45 minutes).
*   **WarningTimes**: Configure when audio countdowns should play before a wipe occurs.

### 🔔 Notifications

Choose your preferred notification provider to match your server's UI:

*   **Options**: `'ox'`, `'qb'`, `'esx'`, `'chat'`, `'gta'`

## Protection Systems

### 🚫 Blacklists

To prevent specific objects from being wiped (or to specifically target debris), add or remove object hashes in:
`Config.Objects.Blacklist`

### 🛡️ Safezones

Define static coordinates where wipes are completely disabled. This is useful for high-traffic areas like:

*   Legion Square
*   Car Dealerships
*   Mechanic Shops

```lua
-- Example Safezone Config
Config.Safezones = {
    { coords = vector3(230.1, -785.2, 30.0), radius = 50.0 },
    -- Add more zones as needed
}
```
