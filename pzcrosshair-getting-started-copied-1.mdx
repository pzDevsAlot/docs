**pz_stance** is a high-performance, polished movement overhaul designed to bring tactical depth and fluid character control to your FiveM server. Built with a focus on immersion and technical stability, it provides a seamless transition between standing, crouching, and proning.

## Features

* **Smart Combat Detection**: Integrated logic that detects when a player is aiming. Instead of changing stances mid-gunfight, the system toggles native stealth movement to maintain tactical positioning.

* **Variable Speed Control**: Fully adjustable movement multipliers for crouching, allowing players to sprint while crouched with custom speed caps.

* **Flexible Input Dispatcher**: Choose between a streamlined Single-Key system (Tap to Crouch / Hold to Prone) or a Dedicated Two-Key system for instant response times.

* **Tactical Maneuvers**: Full support for diving into prone while sprinting and functional forward/backward crawling cycles.

* **Zero-Impact Optimization**: Built using high-efficiency loops that remain at 0.00ms idle, scaling intelligently only when movement logic is active.

## Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Place Resource">
Download the resource and drop the pz_stance folder into your resources directory.
</Step>

<Step title="Configuration">
Open settings.lua to customize the movement experience. Here you can toggle prone entirely, adjust crouch speeds, and choose your preferred input method (Single-Key vs Two-Key).
</Step>

<Step title="Start Resource">
Add the ensure command to your server.cfg:

ensure `pz_stance`


</Step>

<Step title="Exports & Integration">
If you are a developer, you can use the built-in exports to check a player's stance from other scripts:
isCrouched = exports[&#39;pz_stance&#39;]:IsCrouched()
isProne = exports[&#39;pz_stance&#39;]:IsProne()
</Step>
</Steps>
