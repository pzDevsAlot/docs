## Core Settings

🛡️ Combat Mechanics

* Control which PvP restrictions are enforced on your server. This allows you to set a baseline standard that fits your server's specific PvP balance.

* Config.DisableNativeCover: Set to true to completely block players from snapping to walls using the default GTA V cover system (Q / RB).

* Config.EnableAntiHeadglitch: Set to true to activate the dual-point raycasting system that prevents players from shooting when their weapon barrel is obstructed.

👁️ Visual Feedback

* Customize the information players receive when the anti-headglitch system intercepts their shots.

* *Config.ShowObstructionText*: Set to true to display a 3D text indicator at the exact location where the player's bullet is being blocked.

* *Config.ObstructionMessage*: The text string displayed to the player (e.g., "Weapon Blocked" or "Target Obstructed").

* *Config.TextScale & Config.TextColor*: Fine-tune the size and color of the 3D text to match your server's UI aesthetics.
