*pz_commands* is a highly polished, command menu designed to bring modern UI standards and quality-of-life improvements to your FiveM server. Built with a focus on seamless interaction and aesthetic superiority, it provides players with a fast, intuitive way to store, organize, and execute their most used commands without breaking immersion.

## Features

 * *Dynamic Role Integration*: Smart tabs automatically hide or show based on a player's active job, gang, and duty status using built-in framework bridges.
 * *Player-Driven Organization*: Full support for players to add, edit, and manually categorize their custom commands into personal folders and groups.
 * *Seamless Interaction*: Designed for fluid gameplay with a flexible input system. Hold N to quickly pop open the menu and execute commands on the fly, or type /favcommand to lock the menu open for easier folder setup.
 * *Modern UI Aesthetics*: A minimalist, high-end design inspired by top-tier UI frameworks, complete with sleek transitions and a custom reactive cursor.
 * *Zero Database Bloat*: Operates entirely on FiveM's native KVP (Key-Value Pair) system, ensuring fast load times and zero server-side storage impact.
