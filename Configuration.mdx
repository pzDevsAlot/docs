The primary settings are located in config.lua. It is essential to set your framework correctly so the script can communicate with your player data and your server's economy.

<Badge>Support Frameworks</Badge>

<Card title="Core Settings" icon="sparkles">
  Config.Framework = 'qb-core' -- Options: 'esx', 'qb-core', 'custom' Config.AdminCommandPermission = 'admin' -- The ACE permission required for staff commands
</Card>

<Badge>Custom Frameworks</Badge>

If you use a custom or heavily modified core, you must edit the non-escrowed bridge.lua file. This allows you to bridge the gap between pz_vip and your unique server logic.

<Card title="Bridge Integration" icon="bridge">
  Open bridge.lua and map the following functions to your framework's natives:

  GetPlayer - To fetch player data.

  AddMoney - To grant cash/bank rewards.

  AddItem - To handle item rewards.

  AddWeapon - To handle vehicle or weapon rewards.
</Card>

<Badge>VIP Tiers & Rewards</Badge>

Within the Config.Tiers table, you can define your subscription levels.

<Card title="Inheritance" icon="sparkles">
  You can set higher tiers to automatically inherit rewards from lower tiers.

  Reward Ledger: Rewards are not granted instantly upon login; they are added to a ledger, allowing players to claim them at their convenience.
</Card>

<Badge shape="pill">Tebex Automation</Badge>

To automate your shop delivery, add this command to your Tebex package settings under the Commands section:

```
tebex:grantvip transaction id [level] [days]
```

<Note>
  id should be the player's primary identifier (License or Steam). Ensure the level you input matches the numerical ID defined in your Config.Tiers.
