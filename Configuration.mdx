title: "Configuration" description: "How to customize pz_vip for your server framework and tiers."

Core Settings

The primary settings are located in config.lua. It is essential to set your framework correctly so the script can communicate with your player data and your server's economy.

Config.Framework = 'qb-core' -- Options: 'esx', 'qb-core', 'custom'
Config.AdminCommandPermission = 'admin' -- The ACE permission required for staff commands


Custom Frameworks

If you use a custom or heavily modified core, you must edit the non-escrowed bridge.lua file. This allows you to bridge the gap between pz_vip and your unique server logic.

<Card title="Bridge Integration" icon="bridge">
Open bridge.lua and map the following functions to your framework's natives:

GetPlayer - To fetch player data.

AddMoney - To grant cash/bank rewards.

AddItem - To handle item rewards.

AddWeapon - To handle vehicle or weapon rewards.
</Card>

VIP Tiers & Rewards

Within the Config.Tiers table, you can define your subscription levels.

Inheritance: You can set higher tiers to automatically inherit rewards from lower tiers.

Reward Ledger: Rewards are not granted instantly upon login; they are added to a ledger, allowing players to claim them at their convenience.

Tebex Automation

To automate your shop delivery, add this command to your Tebex package settings under the Commands section:

tebex:grantvip {transaction} {id} [level] [days]


<Note>
{id} should be the player's primary identifier (License or Steam). Ensure the level you input matches the numerical ID defined in your Config.Tiers.
