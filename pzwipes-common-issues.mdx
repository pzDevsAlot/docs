## Common Issues

There are currently no known common issues for pz_wipes.

The script is designed to run silently in the background, but misconfiguration can prevent cleanup.

## Troubleshooting Tips

If you find that wipes are not happening or errors occur:

* **Check Config**: Ensure you haven't missed a comma , or made a syntax error in settings.lua.

* **Check Dependencies**: Ensure oxmysql is installed and started before pz_wipes in your server.cfg.

* **Reinstall Files**: Ensure the resource is fully updated and no files are missing or corrupted.
