Getting Started

Welcome to the official documentation for pz_antimapcollision.

This script is the definitive solution for one of the most common and frustrating problems for server owners: fake doors and invisible barriers.

If you have a custom MLO with a static door you should be able to walk through, or an invisible wall blocking a path that needs to be accessible, this script is designed to fix it. It is a lightweight, standalone tool that allows you to create precise "noclip zones" to let players pass through this static map collision safely.

Features

Pass Through Fake Doors: Lets players walk through static map collision, like fake MLO doors or invisible barriers.

Keeps Players Safe: Prevents players from falling through the map while inside a phasing zone.

Precise Box Zones: Configure exact box-shaped zones (position, size, and rotation) to perfectly match any doorway.

No Doorlock Conflicts: This script does not interfere with your server's door lock system. It only affects static map geometry.

Standalone: No dependencies (does not require ox_lib or any other resource).

Universal Compatibility: Works on all game builds.

Easy Setup: Includes an in-game command to generate exact config code.

Installation

Download the resource.

Drag and drop the pz_antimapcollision folder into your server's resources directory.
