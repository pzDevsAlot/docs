Getting Started & Installation

To get the most out of pz_Dev resources, follow this structured guide to ensure a smooth installation:

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Global Requirements & Artifacts">
Before installing, ensure your server artifacts are up to date.

At an absolute minimum, our scripts require **Server Artifact version 7290** or higher. We strongly suggest using the latest **Recommended** artifact listing for your server's operating system.

*Note: This is different from your Game Build (e.g., 3095), which is also fully supported.*


</Step>

<Step title="2. Download from Keymaster">
To download your purchased asset, head over to the Cfx.re Keymaster Portal.

1. Log in and navigate to the **"Granted Assets"** tab.
2. Search for `pz-` to find your assets.

*Note: After purchase, it may take up to 5 minutes for the asset to appear in your portal account.*


</Step>

<Step title="3. Install the Resource">
Extract or open the zip file you just downloaded.

**Important:** Do NOT drag the downloaded folder directly into your server blindly. Open it first. The folders inside are the actual resources that you must add to your server's `resources` directory (e.g., `pz_antimapcollision`).


</Step>

<Step title="4. Configuration">
Open the config.lua file within the resource folder. Modify the settings to match your server's economy, permission levels, and specific needs before starting the script.
</Step>

<Step title="5. Restart & Verify">
Fully restart your FiveM server.

If you just start the script via the console or txAdmin while the server is running, you will likely run into a Keymaster escrow error. Restarting your server ensures your server is aware of your new license and authenticates the script correctly.
