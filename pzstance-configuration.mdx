## Core Settings

### ⌨️ Input System

Control how players interact with the stance system. You can choose between a streamlined single-key approach or dedicated competitive keybinds.

- `UseTwoKeys`: Set to `true` to use separate keys for crouching and proning. Set to `false` for the Tap-to-Crouch / Hold-to-Prone system.
- `Key`: The primary key used for the Single-Key system (Default: `'LCONTROL'`).
- `HoldTimeToProne`: How long (in milliseconds) the key must be held to trigger prone instead of a crouch toggle.
- `CrouchKey` / `ProneKey`: Dedicated keys used only when `UseTwoKeys` is enabled.

### 🚶 Stance Behavior

Define the global availability and combat rules for different stances.

- `EnableProne`: Set to `false` to completely disable the prone and crawling system, leaving only the crouch functionality.
- `AllowProneFiring`: Toggles the ability to aim and shoot weapons while in the prone state.
- `AllowCrouchSprinting`: Toggles whether players can use the sprint key while in a crouched state.

## Movement Settings

### ⚡ Speed Multipliers

Fine-tune how fast players move when using custom stances. Note that these values act as multipliers (`1.0` is standard).

- `CrouchMoveSpeed`: The multiplier for standard walking and strafing while crouched.
- `CrouchSprintSpeed`: The multiplier applied when the player holds the sprint key while crouched.
