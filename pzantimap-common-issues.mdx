Troubleshooting Tips

If you find that a zone is not working:

Check Syntax: Ensure you haven't missed a comma , at the end of your zone lines in config.lua.

Restart: Ensure you have restarted the script (restart pz_antimapcollision) after saving the config file.

Zone Placement: If the zone is too small, you might still collide with the door frame. Try increasing the size vector slightly in the config.
