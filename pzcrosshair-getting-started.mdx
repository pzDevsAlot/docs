**pz_crosshair** is a highly optimized, feature-rich crosshair system designed to give your players total control over their gunplay experience. Built for competitive and roleplay servers alike, it allows users to build their perfect `reticle` using native drawing methods or custom image URLs — all without dropping a single frame.

## Features

* **Dual Rendering Modes**: Choose between highly optimized native drawing (lines, dots, outlines) or input a direct URL for custom image-based crosshairs.

* **Deep Customization**: Full control over shape, visuals, and colors, including gap size, line length/thickness, and dot toggles.

* **Profile System & Presets**: Players can save multiple personal profiles, quickly swap between them, or load server-defined presets.

* **Share & Import**: Built-in base64 code generation allows players to instantly copy their crosshair settings and share them with friends.

* **Dynamic Resolution Scaling**: Automatically recalculates geometry if a player changes their screen resolution or aspect ratio.

* **Adaptive UI**: Natively supports standard ox_lib context menus and dialogs, while fully integrating with `pz_utility` (if installed).
