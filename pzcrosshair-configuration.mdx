## Core Settings

### 🎯 Default Styling

You can set the baseline crosshair appearance for first-time players. These values are applied before a player creates or saves their own profile.

- `mode`: Choose the default rendering method ('native' or 'image').
- `thickness / length / gap`: Control the default geometry and size of the native crosshair.
- `color / dotColor`: Define the default RGB colors (e.g., `{0, 255, 0}` for green).
- `dot / outline`: Toggle the visibility of the center dot and black outlines.

### 🖥️ UI Preferences

Control how the script interfaces with your server's menus:

- `UsePzUtility`: Set to `true` to use the immersive pz_utility UI, or `false` to default to standard `ox_lib` context menus and input dialogs.

## Advanced Systems

### 📋 Server Presets

You can define pre-configured crosshairs that all players can quickly access from the public Presets menu. This is great for offering classic shooter layouts out-of-box.

### 🔗 Custom Images

If you want to allow players to use image URLs for their reticles, they can simply paste the direct image link (e.g., Imgur or Discord attachment) into the Image Editor UI.

```lua
-- Example Preset Config
Config.Presets = {
    ['dot'] = { label = 'Simple Dot', active = true, mode = 'native', dot = true, length = 0, outline = true },
    ['classic'] = { label = 'Classic Cross', active = true, mode = 'native', thickness = 2, length = 12, gap = 4, dot = false },
    -- Add more presets as needed
}
```
