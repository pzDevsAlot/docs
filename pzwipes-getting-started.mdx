`pz_wipes` is a modular, high-performance cleanup system built to keep your FiveM server running smooth and stable. It intelligently manages world entities (Vehicles, Peds, Objects) to reduce lag, clear debris, and prevent griefing — `all without disrupting roleplay.`

## Features

* **Smart Vehicle Wipe**: Automatically removes broken, exploded, or abandoned vehicles while protecting player-owned ones.

* **Anti-Grief Object Wipe**: Cleans up modder spam (cages, windmills) and common debris using a configurable blacklist.

* **Safezone System**: Prevents wipes in protected areas (Legion, dealerships, etc.).

* **Audio Warnings**: Immersive audio countdowns notify players before wipes occur — `no intrusive UI.`

* **Framework Agnostic**: Works out‑of‑the‑box with `QBCore`, `ESX`, and `Ox Core`.
